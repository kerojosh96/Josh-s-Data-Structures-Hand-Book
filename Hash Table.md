# Operations

A \[widget\] supports the following operations:

* A hash table uses a hash function to turn an element into a indexable value. If done properly this can allow O(1) access of an element. If two values have the same key and a collision occurs, the performance can degrade into O(n) as it chains multiple arrays of linked lists at each collided value.

# Use Cases

An \[widget\] is useful \[when\] \[why\].

It is not as good as \[what] \[why\].

# Example

```
sample code showing creation, and exercising all of the operations
or
a program that doesn't use the structure, and then a version that does
