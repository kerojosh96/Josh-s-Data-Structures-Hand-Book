# \[Widget\]

A binary heap is a type of complete binary tree in which has two distinct types, a min heap and a max heap. In a min heap, the root node must be smaller then it’s children which recursively effects every node. In am max heap, the root node must be bigger then it’s children which recursively effects every node.  The nodes of a binary heap can be represented and stored in a list.

# In Memory

In memory, a \[widget\] looks like this:

\[sketch or diagram\]

\[description of diagram\]

# Operations

A \[widget\] supports the following operations:

* Because of the sorting algorithms involved a min or max heap, it is always kept balanced and because of this, when traversing down a min or max heap half of the tree gets ignored because it is either less or greater then search value recursively. For insertion and deletion, This then becomes O(log(n)).  
* name: description, Big O efficiency, and explain why / what that means

# Use Cases

An \[widget\] is useful \[when\] \[why\].

It is not as good as \[what] \[why\].

# Example

```
sample code showing creation, and exercising all of the operations
or
a program that doesn't use the structure, and then a version that does
```
