# \[Widget\]

 a priority que is similar to a regular queue but in a priority queue each element has a value that corresponds to a priority level. If an element has a higher priority, then another element the highest priority gets to the front of the queue first. This is done with the help of a binary heap. 

# In Memory

In memory, a \[widget\] looks like this:

\[description of diagram\]

# Operations

A \[widget\] supports the following operations:

* because a priority queue uses a binary heap, insertion and deletion of elements onto a priority que is O(log(n))
* searching and accessing a binary heap is O(n) because it is only partially sorted and it sill needs iteration.  

# Use Cases

 because a priority queue uses a binary heap, insertion and deletion of elements onto a priority que is O(log(n)).

It is not as good as \[what] \[why\].

# Example

```
sample code showing creation, and exercising all of the operations
or
a program that doesn't use the structure, and then a version that does
```
