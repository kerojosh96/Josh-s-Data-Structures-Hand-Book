# \[Widget\]

A graph is a nonlinear data structure that uses nodes and are connected with edges. A graph can best be best defined with the following equation. G = (V,E) Where a graph G is an ordered pair of a set of vertices V and a set of edges E. 

In a graph using a directed edge each edge would be represented using an ordered pair starting at the origin and ending at the destination. In a directed graph, one way traversal from origin to destination is only allowed.   


# In Memory

In memory, a \[widget\] looks like this:

\[sketch or diagram\]

\[description of diagram\]

# Operations

A \[widget\] supports the following operations:

* name: description, Big O efficiency, and explain why / what that means
* name: description, Big O efficiency, and explain why / what that means

# Use Cases

An \[widget\] is useful \[when\] \[why\].

It is not as good as \[what] \[why\].

# Example

```
sample code showing creation, and exercising all of the operations
or
a program that doesn't use the structure, and then a version that does
