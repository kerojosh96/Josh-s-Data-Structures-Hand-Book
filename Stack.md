# Stack

A stack is an ordered collection of elements in which items are either added (pushed) or removed (pop) from only one end. A stack is a Last-In-First-Out structure or (LIFO) and elements cannot be added or removed anywhere but the top. 

# In Memory

In memory, a \[widget\] looks like this:

\[description of diagram\]

# Operations

A \[widget\] supports the following operations:

* The efficiency of push and pop are both O(1) because they both only can be added/removed from the head and no iteration is needed.
* The efficiency of accessing and searching a stack is o(n) because iteration is needed from the top to the search value.    


# Use Cases

An \[widget\] is useful \[when\] \[why\].

It is not as good as \[what] \[why\].

# Example

```
sample code showing creation, and exercising all of the operations
or
a program that doesn't use the structure, and then a version that does
```
