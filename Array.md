# Operations

A \[widget\] supports the following operations:

* Accessing an array is O(1) because the location for the value is known the retrieval process is equal for every element in an array.  
* Searching and inserting and deleting in an array is O(n) because iteration is needed to get to the desired location.   


# Use Cases

It is not as good as \[what] \[why\].

# Example

```
test = []
test.append(1)#adds to test

test.append(3)#adds to test
test.pop()#removes the last element 
print(test[1])
