# AVL Tree

An AVL tree is a type of binary search tree that preforms self-balancing operations on it’s nodes in a way to optimize performance. An AVL tree can only have 1 subtree that differs in height from either side of a root’s left or right node, else, it is rebalanced accordingly.  

# In Memory

In memory, a \[widget\] looks like this:

\[description of diagram\]

# Operations

A \[widget\] supports the following operations:

*Searching an AVL tree is O(log(n)) because when the tree is balanced properly, comparing a search value to a node will likely cut the possible values in half as it moves down one side of the tree and recursively repeats the halving process.  
* Adding and deleting nodes is also O(log(n)) because only half the tree is needed to iterate down to the addition/deletion spot. 

# Use Cases

An \[widget\] is useful \[when\] \[why\].

It is not as good as \[what] \[why\].

# Example

```
sample code showing creation, and exercising all of the operations
or
a program that doesn't use the structure, and then a version that does
