# \[Widget\]

A linked list is an ordered collection of elements in which each node points to the next node. The first node is called the head and each node that is at the end of a list has a default null value. 

There are a few different types of linked lists.
* in a singly linked list, each node has only one pointer, pointing to the next node.
*	in a doubly linked list, each node has two points one pointing forwards and the other backwards.   
*	In a circularly linked list, the ending node in the list points to the head of the list.
