# Operations

A \[widget\] supports the following operations:

* Accessing and searching a queue is O(n) because a queue can only be dequeued 1 element and at time, it may have to iterate across the entire queue to find the search value, so, it is O(n).  
* insertion and deletion of a queue better know as enque and dequeue, are O(1)   

# Use Cases

An \[widget\] is useful \[when\] \[why\].

It is not as good as \[what] \[why\].

# Example

```
sample code showing creation, and exercising all of the operations
or
a program that doesn't use the structure, and then a version that does
